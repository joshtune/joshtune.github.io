title: About Me
---

I was raised in Kiribati, an island nation where community comes first and the sea is never far away. I grew up fishing—early mornings on the water taught me patience, respect for nature, and a love for quiet focus. Today I’m happily married with three wonderful kids, and we keep that sense of closeness alive with family adventures and unplanned moments that turn into memories. I love staying active—pickleball for the quick exchanges and camaraderie, fishing for the calm and connection back to my roots, and tennis for the rhythm and challenge. Each one ties me to the islands in its own way and keeps life balanced and fun.
