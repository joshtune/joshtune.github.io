Core to my love of Software Development, is the notion of being able to build something from, what seems like nothing. I would love to one day write my own Software that would allow me to help others, on a global scale, but I know I cannot do it alone, so, I have committed myself to work amongst great talent. Over 20 years of experience in Software Development has taught me that you cannot eat an elephant in one bite, but instead you must seek for small wins as you (1) collaborate or AI it, (2) build it, (3) test it, (4) refactor it and then (5) do it again.  Software Development has taught me that group coding sessions and code reviews are an essential tool in developing, learning and promoting good programming practices and patterns across the board.
