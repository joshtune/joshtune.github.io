I was lucky to attend a training provided by our Church Youth Leaders, David J. Wonderli, _First Counselor, General Young Mens Presidency_ and Tamara W. Runia, _First Counselor, General Young Womens Presidency_, and they spoke of the Lord's youth program. Here are my notes.

## Summary

The Lord’s youth program is centered on three guiding principles: Believe in Christ, Belong with Christ, and Become more like Christ. These are not separate programs, but a unified framework designed to help youth grow into lifelong disciples of Jesus Christ. As leaders, our role is to create opportunities, provide mentoring, and model discipleship so each young person learns to live this pattern for themselves.

## Disciples Believe in Christ

### Lesson Taught

Belief is the foundation. Youth need daily habits that anchor them to Jesus Christ: prayer, scripture study, repentance, ordinances, and seminary. Elder Uchtdorf reminded us that traditions alone are not enough—faith must be nourished through personal discipleship.

### Leader Actions

Encourage habits of discipleship: prayer, scripture study, repentance, service.

Strengthen the Sabbath: involve youth in meaningful sacrament participation (teaching, conducting, greeting, administering ordinances).

Promote seminary: help youth see it as a source of answers, friendships, and testimony.

Use the FSY Guide: teach them how to apply gospel principles to everyday life.

### Leadership Reminder

Show youth how discipleship looks by modeling consistency in your own worship and daily devotion.

## Disciples Belong with Christ

### Lesson Taught

Every young person needs to feel that they belong in Christ’s Church. Belonging isn’t passive; it comes when youth are noticed, valued, and given ownership. Elder Uchtdorf emphasized that the rising generation must know they belong in His Church.

### Leader Actions

Give ownership: assign meaningful responsibilities in quorums and classes.

Plan together: involve youth in creating and carrying out activities and service projects.

Create belonging spaces: build friendships through camps, FSY, conferences, and weekly activities.

Safeguard inclusion: follow Church safety and conduct guidelines to ensure uplifting, Christ-centered experiences.

### Leadership Reminder

Belonging grows strongest when leaders intentionally notice the one who feels left out and bring them in.

## Disciples Become More Like Christ

### Lesson Taught

The goal is transformation. Youth are meant to discover their divine identity and grow into covenant sons and daughters of God. President Nelson taught that overcoming the world happens over a lifetime as we embrace the Doctrine of Christ repeatedly. Elder Uchtdorf taught that they are to become their best selves, as Heavenly Parents intended.

### Leader Actions

Mentor intentionally: pair youth with trusted leaders who guide, not just instruct.

Provide responsibility: let them lead, serve, and grow into assignments.

Prepare for covenants:

Temple recommend at 11.

Regular temple attendance.

Endowment at 18.

Teach ministering: give youth consistent opportunities to serve others in meaningful ways.

### Leadership Reminder

Becoming is not a one-time event; it is the lifelong work of discipleship. Leaders succeed when youth see their own growth and divine potential.

## Conclusion

The youth program is not about activities, checklists, or filling time—it is about discipleship. As leaders, our charge is to guide young people through the cycle of believing, belonging, and becoming. When youth are anchored in Christ, feel that they belong in His Church, and are given opportunities to become more like Him, they will develop into lifelong disciples who can lead, serve, and strengthen the kingdom.

> Leadership Charge: Create opportunities for youth to Believe in Christ, Belong with Christ, and Become like Christ. In doing so, you will help them build testimonies and identities that last a lifetime.
