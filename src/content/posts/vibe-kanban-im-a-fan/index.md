I’ve been using [Vibe Kanban](https://github.com/BloopAI/vibe-kanban) lately, and it clicked fast. This post is a live example: I made a card (“write a quick blog entry”), then iterated until it sounded like me.

What I like is the combo of simple structure + AI help:

- Capture intent as a card, not a vague mental note.
- Break work into small, finishable slices.
- Make tradeoffs obvious by keeping the board honest.
- Use AI to turn “I want this” into steps and a first draft, without giving up control.

It’s been a nice little amplifier for writing, refactors, automations, and docs — basically anything that benefits from momentum and clarity.

A coworker also pointed me at Steve Yegge’s [Gastown](https://github.com/steveyegge/gastown), which seems to rhyme with the same idea: give work a concrete shape and keep the feedback loop tight.

Anyway: I’m a fan. If you want a lightweight way to stay oriented and ship more reliably, Vibe Kanban is worth a try.
