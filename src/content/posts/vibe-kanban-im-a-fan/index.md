I’ve been using Vibe Kanban lately, and I’m kind of amazed at how quickly it clicked.

In fact, this post is basically a live example: I dropped a card on the board that said “write a quick blog entry about why I’m a fan,” and then iterated from there until it sounded like me.

It’s one of those tools that looks almost too simple at first — a board, a few cards, a clear “what’s next” — but the moment you pair that structure with an AI assistant, the whole thing starts to *amplify* what you’re capable of.

The biggest win for me is momentum without chaos.
Instead of holding a fuzzy plan in my head (and losing half of it the second I context-switch), I can capture the intent as a card, get specific about the outcome, and then work it down into smaller moves. The AI helps me go from “I want this” to “here are the steps” to “here’s a first pass,” without feeling like I’m giving up control.

What surprised me is how much the Kanban shape matters:

- It makes the work visible, which makes tradeoffs honest.
- It forces scope into bite-sized chunks that are easy to start and easy to finish.
- It turns “figuring it out” into something you can actually track and iterate on.

And the more I use it, the more it feels like a general-purpose *amplifier* for projects that used to stall out: writing, refactors, little automations, docs, and all the “I should really…” tasks that never quite make it to done.

One related thing a coworker mentioned (and that I’m curious to dig into more) is Steve Yegge’s Gastown:

At a glance it seems to rhyme with the same idea: give your work a concrete shape, keep the feedback loop tight, and use AI as leverage — not as a substitute for thinking, but as a force multiplier for shipping.

Anyway: I’m a fan. If you’ve been looking for a workflow that makes it easier to start, easier to finish, and easier to stay oriented while you build, Vibe Kanban is worth a try.
