## A new venture

Join me on my journey to better understand Artificial Intelligence (AI) and how it can help you build better software.

## Who this series is for

Frontend and full-stack engineers (SvelteKit/React/TypeScript) who want AI features that do more than chat: fetch data, call APIs, and run controlled actions through a standard interface.

## Why MCP (briefly)

MCP gives you a predictable way to expose **tools** (actions) and **resources** (read-only data) as a contract your app—and LLM runtimes—can discover and call. You’ll stop gluing prompts to bespoke endpoints and start shipping typed, testable capabilities you can reuse across projects.

## What we’ll build together

Two end-to-end mini-projects you can ship or adapt:

1. **Docs Q\&A MCP**
   - Tools: `searchDocs(query)`, `getDoc(section)`
   - Frontend: a chat panel that lists tools, accepts input, streams answers with citations

2. **Task Runner MCP** (e.g., issues/tickets)
   - Tools: `createIssue(title, labels)`, `labelIssue(id, labels)`
   - Frontend: a form+result view that builds JSON args, invokes tools, and shows outcomes

## The path (8 focused parts)

1. **MCP 101 + tiny TS server**
   Learn the vocabulary (servers, tools, resources), spin up a minimal server via **stdio**, then expose it over **Streamable HTTP**.

2. **Build your first real server (TS)**
   Register multiple tools with **Zod/JSON Schema** inputs, return structured outputs, add basic logging and error handling.

3. **Transports & gateways**
   When to use stdio (local) vs HTTP (remote). Add a small **stdio→HTTP bridge** so browsers and edge functions can reach your server.

4. **Frontend options**
   Three integration patterns: (a) direct browser client (when available), (b) a Node/edge **client service** your app talks to, (c) hosted gateways. Trade-offs for security, latency, and DX.

5. **SvelteKit/React integration (chat + tools UI)**
   Build a chat panel that **discovers tools**, validates args, and **streams** results. Handle partial updates, cancellations, and errors.

6. **Auth, quotas, and secrets**
   Add per-user quotas, request signing, and secret handling for remote MCP servers; lock down CORS and rate limits.

7. **Deploy & scale**
   Containerize the server, add health checks, expose **/mcp** endpoints, and scale stateless workers. Observability basics: logs, metrics, tracing.

8. **Case study & hardening**
   Ship the Docs Q\&A or Task Runner end-to-end. Add retry/backoff, idempotency, red-team tests, and a tiny evaluation set for regression catching.

## What you’ll learn (outcomes)

- Design **typed tools/resources** your UI can reliably call.
- Stream results to the browser with **Streamable HTTP** and sensible UX.
- Choose the right **integration pattern** (direct, proxy, or hosted).
- Secure your server with **auth, quotas, and CORS**.
- Deploy and observe a production-ready MCP endpoint.

## What you’ll need

- Node 18+, TypeScript, and comfort with SvelteKit or React
- Optional: Zod, a vector DB (for the Docs Q\&A project), and a hosted LLM provider
- Basic Docker if you plan to deploy

## How to follow along

Each part includes:

- **Copy-pasteable code blocks** that compile
- A tiny dataset or fixtures
- Notes on **latency/cost** and error cases
- One clear “next step” so you can extend it in your app
